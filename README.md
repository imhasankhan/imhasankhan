# Muhammad Hasan Khan  
### Electrical & Automation Engineer

Electrical & Automation Engineer with hands-on experience in industrial automation,
PLC systems, and SCADA engineering, currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Electrical
Engineering and Information Technology (Automation) in Germany.

I have worked on live industrial systems where reliability, safety, and
maintainability are critical. My experience spans industrial automation,
power systems, embedded electronics, and engineering-focused software tools,
with a strong emphasis on practical implementation rather than theoretical
demonstrations.
