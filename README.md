### Custom UI for 2D/3D Laser Sensor – Keyence LJ-X8400
Portfolio project demonstrating a custom industrial user interface for the Keyence
LJ-X8400 laser profiler. The system replicates and extends core sensor software
functionality with real-time visualization and measurement features.

Key aspects:
- Full-stack architecture using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend)
- Real-time 2D profile streaming via WebSocket
- Interactive measurement tools (point-to-point, vertical, horizontal)
- 3D surface reconstruction by stitching multiple 2D scans
- Designed for flexible and robotic measurement setups
- Proprietary Keyence SDK excluded (portfolio version)

### DNN-Based Power System State Estimation (MATLAB)
Data-driven power system state estimation project using Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
The workflow includes MATLAB-based dataset generation, multi-level Gaussian noise
modeling, DNN training, and evaluation on the IEEE 14-bus system. The work was later
validated through an IEEE conference publication.

### Transmission Line Analysis Using MATLAB GUI
Portfolio case-study describing a MATLAB GUI–based engineering tool for analyzing
overhead transmission line geometries. The project focused on studying the impact of
electrical and mechanical parameters on transmission efficiency and loss behavior
through interactive analysis.
